# HospitalSimulator
"A stupid project that allows me to flex my c++ muscles"

The purpose of this project is to find a way to implement as many C++ language features as possible.

The project will  cover:

Abstract Classes

Pure Virtual Functions

Inheritance

Namespaces

Multithreading

Pointers

STL containters

Data structures like priority queues (my favorite of all!)

References

SDL2 for the simulator graphics

Connecting to a sqlite database

Templated Classes

Operator Overloading

Structs with the operator() overloaded

Linking with dynamic libraries

Linking with static libraries.

Almost all of these features are implemented already. Some of the missing ones are already implemented in 
a rough draft of this project found here:
