# HospitalSimulator
"A stupid project that allows me to flex my c++ muscles"

The purpose of this project is to find a way to implement as many C++ language features as possible.
The project will  cover:
Abstract Classes
Pure Virtual Functions
Inheritance
Namespaces
Multithreading
Pointers
STL containters
Data structures like priority queues (my favorite of all!)
References
SDL2 for the simulator graphics
Connecting to a sqlite database
Templated Classes
Operator Overloading
Structs with the operator() overloaded
Linking with dynamic libraries
Linking with static libraries.

Almost all of these features are implemented already. Some of the missing ones are already implemented in 
a rough draft of this project found here:
